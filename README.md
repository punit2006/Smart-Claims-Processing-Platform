# 🧠 AI-Driven Claims Automation System

This project implements a backend solution for automating insurance claims workflows using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and transformer-based models. It processes claim documents (PDF/DOCX/images), classifies claims intelligently, and routes them for further action — all while ensuring compliance with policy rules.

---

## 📝 Description

This AI-powered backend system streamlines claims handling by:

* Ingesting various document types (PDF, DOCX, image scans).
* Extracting and understanding claim content using OCR and transformers.
* Classifying claims based on type, urgency, and coverage.
* Automatically applying business rules to verify eligibility.
* Routing claims to appropriate departments for resolution.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Document Processing

* Supports PDF, DOCX, and scanned images using `PyPDF`, `docx`, and `pytesseract`.

### ✅ Claims Classification

* Uses a transformer model (`mistral-7b` via Groq API) to identify claim type and priority.

### ✅ Workflow Optimization

* Based on claim type and policy terms, routes cases to respective virtual departments (e.g., urgent, fraud, regular).

### ✅ Policy Compliance

* Applies configurable rules to validate claims against predefined exclusions or coverage limits.

## 🔍 Sample Use-Case

```python
file_path = "/content/sample_claim.pdf"
file_type = "pdf"
user_query = "What is the claim about?"
api_key = "your_groq_api_key"

result = process_claim_document(file_path, file_type, user_query, api_key)
print(result)
```

---

## 📊 Batch Processing with CSV

You can create a CSV file like this:

| file\_path                 | file\_type | user\_query              |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| /content/sample\_claim.pdf | pdf        | What is the claim about? |

Then loop through the CSV rows to process documents in bulk.
